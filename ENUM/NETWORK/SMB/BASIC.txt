Server Message Block (SMB) is a communication protocol[1] originally developed 
in 1983 by Barry A. Feigenbaum at IBM[2] and intended to provide shared access 
to files and printers across nodes on a network of systems running IBM's OS/2. 
It also provides an authenticated inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism.

SMB: Could be vulnerable to SMB exploits like MS17-010

What would be the correct syntax to access an SMB share called "secret" as user 
"suit" 
on a machine with the IP 10.10.10.2 on the default port?

smbclient //10.10.10.2/secret -U suit

quand on est dans une smb cosole on peut faire help pour voir le peu de commande
 on a.

SERVICE = microsoft-ds?
